This example adds custom poison attribute/effects to demonstrate the following:

* How to use attributes and perks.
* How to use timer.
* How to use custom text sprites (text emojis).

It adds a "Poisoned" attribute that will apply damage every second to the character, and adds a "Toxic Substance" attribute that makes a character's attack apply "Poisoned" status to targets. A timer is used to check the "Poisoned" attribute every second and apply damage.

In addition, 2 text sprites are added in the `additoins/sprites` folder and used in the perk/attribute descriptions.
